======================

**Introduction**
================

The X-Pulse 360 Review process enables Xgrid a comprehensive quarterly evaluation framework for employees, fostering continuous improvement and feedback.

**Key Phases:**
---------------

* **Active Phase:** Initiates the quarterly review cycle. During this phase, employees conduct self-assessments, managers review their team members, and peer-to-peer evaluation (future implementation) takes place. Reviews can be saved as drafts but cannot be edited post-submission.

* **Processing Phase:** Marks the ongoing evaluation stage.

* **Done Phase:** Concludes the review cycle, freezing the review form. Final remarks can be edited until this phase.

**Cycle Frequency and Submission Process:**
--------------------------------------------

* Quarterly reviews occur four times a year, aligning with Xgrid’s organizational objectives.

* Reviews are submitted only once for each quarter and require manager approval before completion.

* Drafts can be saved before submission but become inaccessible after the Active phase deadline.

**Final Remarks and Accessibility:**
-------------------------------------
* The Final Remarks section is editable by the manager before the Done phase.

* The Final Remarks section can be edited any time if the review process isn’t in the Done phase. Any user can only see his Final Remarks for a review once that review has been moved to the Done phase.
